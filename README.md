# Face-Recognition-Attendence-System
Project Overview

Managing student attendance manually is time-consuming and prone to errors such as proxy attendance. To overcome these challenges, this project presents a Smart Face Recognition–based Attendance Management System using Python.
The system automatically marks attendance by recognizing students' faces through a live webcam video stream, ensuring accuracy and reducing manual effort.

By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, this system detects and recognizes faces in real time and records attendance only when the student is physically present

(a)Features

1.Real-time face detection using a live webcam

2.Face recognition using trained facial data

3.Eliminates proxy attendance

4.Automatic date and time-based attendance marking

5.Attendance stored securely for future reference

6.Fast and efficient processing using OpenCV and dlib

(b)Technologies Used

1.Python

2.OpenCV – for video capture and frame processing

3.dlib – for face detection and face recognition

4.NumPy – for numerical computations

5.OS and CSV modules – for file handling and attendance storage
